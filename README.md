This repo contains the source code for a simple application, written in Go and Javascript. The application uses the [pgx driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx) to connect to and communicate with an existing [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/) cluster.

It also allows you to verify your webhook URL with Zoom.
